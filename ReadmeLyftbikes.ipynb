    " - The Lyft Bike Rentals data set was picked because it was very recent and I was curious to find out the customer base for their bike rentals.  I have visited the San Francisco area before.  I enjoyed finding a few popular bike station locations for the college aged customers.  It would not have been possible to find them that quickly without the help of scatter plots."

    "\n",
    ">The starting station where users rent their Lyft bike can make a difference.  There are two gaps in the plot at station id 300 and 410 as these stations are predominantly used by college aged students.  I looked up both locations and found them to be close to universities.  \n",

    "\n",
    "> Males rode on avg for 11 minutes, females for 13.5 minutes, and other for almost 13 minutes.  This is all for riders who are 34 years of age or younger."
